OL,9, the Video In connector and slowly

OL,11, until the header row appears at the    
OL,12, top. Adjustment is complete when pages 
OL,13, load reliably without missing lines.   
OL,15, Once the Signal Level Adjustment is    
OL,16, set, it should not be necessary to     
OL,17, change it again unless changing source.
OL,19, Allow enough time for the Raspberry Pi
